	- (Smith, 2020, p. 170).
	- All lines after the first line of each entry in your reference list 
	  should be indented one-half inch from the left margin. This is called 
	  hanging indentation.
	- All authors' names should be inverted (i.e., last names should be provided first).
	- Authors' first and middle names should be written as initials.
	- For example, the reference entry for a source written by Jane Marie Smith would begin with "Smith, J. M."
	- If a middle name isn't available, just initialize the author's first name: "Smith, J."
